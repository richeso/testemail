f you want to test your API before using it in a client application, you can invoke your REST services straight from a browser address bar. 
For example, you could try:

http://localhost:3000/rooms
You will only be able to test your GET services that way. A more versatile solution to test RESTful services is to use cURL, 
a command line utility for transferring data with URL syntax.

For example, using cURL, you can test the Wine Cellar API with the following commands:

Get all rooms:
curl -i -X GET --user richard.cheso@gmail.com:password http://localhost:3000/rooms 

Get pokemon with _id value of pikachu (use a value that exists in your database):
curl -i -X GET --user richard.cheso@gmail.com:password http://localhost:3000/rooms/id/BlueRoom 

Add a new Room: TriggerHappy
curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"roomname": "BigComfyCouch", "secret": "126789", "defaultMap": "CityScape", "players": [{"playername": "Julie", "publicip": "1.2.3.4", "privateip": "4.5.6.7"}, {"playername": "Andy", "publicip": "43.24.85.42", "privateip": "91.25.63.74"}] }' --user richard.cheso@gmail.com:password http://localhost:3000/rooms/add

Modify Room  with _id value of HellCity:
curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"roomname": "TriggerHappy", "secret": "126789", "defaultMap": "CityScape", "players": [{"playername": "Julie", "publicip": "1.2.3.4", "privateip": "4.5.6.7"}, {"playername": "Andy", "publicip": "43.24.85.42", "privateip": "91.25.63.74"}] }' --user richard.cheso@gmail.com:password http://localhost:3000/rooms/update/TriggerHappy
curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"roomname": "TriggerSad", "secret": "2334" }' --user richard.cheso@gmail.com:password http://localhost:3000/rooms/update/TriggerHappy
